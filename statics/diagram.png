PNG Architecture Diagram Placeholder
[This would contain a visual diagram of the P2P architecture showing:
- Peer nodes
- Discovery service
- Control protocol connections
- Data transfer paths
- Message flow]

Note: In a real project, this would be an actual PNG image file.
For demonstration purposes, this is a text placeholder.
